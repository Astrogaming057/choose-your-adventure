You try to manually adjust the thrusters, but you're not used to flying in these conditions. The ship starts to wobble as you struggle to maintain control.

The crystalline formations below seem to be pulsing with energy, and you're starting to feel disoriented. Your hands are sweaty, and you're gripping the controls too tightly.

What do you do?
