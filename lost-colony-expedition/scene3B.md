# üî¨ Scene 3B: Crystal Analysis

You decide to analyze the crystal formations first. Dr. Kim sets up her portable lab while you and Lieutenant Patel provide security.

The analysis reveals something astonishing: the crystals are not just alive - they're a form of silicon-based life that has been evolving for millions of years. They communicate through electromagnetic fields and can store vast amounts of information.

Dr. Kim discovers that the crystals have been studying the colonists, learning about human biology and consciousness. They've been trying to understand how to coexist with organic life.

> "Captain, these crystals are incredibly advanced," Dr. Kim reports. "They're not hostile - they're curious. They want to learn from us, but their methods are... invasive."

The crystals begin to respond to your presence, pulsing with different colors and patterns. It's almost like they're trying to communicate with you directly.

What do you do?
