# 📡 Scene 2C: Communication Attempt

You decide to try establishing communication first. Mac boosts the ship's communication array while Dr. Kim scans for any frequencies that might be in use.

After hours of trying different frequencies, you finally get a response. But it's not what you expected.

> "This is... this is Dr. Elena Vasquez from Colony Alpha-7. If anyone can hear this, please help us. We're trapped underground. The crystals... they changed everything. They're not just growing - they're thinking."

The message repeats every few minutes, but Dr. Vasquez sounds desperate and confused. She mentions something about "the transformation" and "becoming one with the crystals."

Lieutenant Patel picks up something else on the scanners: there are multiple life signs underground, but they're not all human.

How do you respond?
