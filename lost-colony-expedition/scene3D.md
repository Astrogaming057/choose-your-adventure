# ğŸšª Scene 3D: Entering the Dome

You decide to enter the dome to investigate. The crystalline material is surprisingly easy to pass through - it's like walking through a thick gel that solidifies behind you.

Inside, you find the colony frozen in time. Families sit at dinner tables, children play with toys, but everything is encased in crystal. The colonists aren't dead - they're preserved, their consciousness trapped within the crystalline matrix.

Dr. Kim's scanner detects faint brain activity from the preserved colonists. They're alive, but in some kind of stasis.

> "Captain, I think the crystals are trying to preserve them," Dr. Kim whispers. "But I don't know if we can wake them up."

What do you do?
