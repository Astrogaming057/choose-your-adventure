# ðŸ’€ Ending 11: Crystal Overload

You decide to ignore the warnings and approach the crystals directly. Despite Dr. Kim's concerns about the electromagnetic interference, you walk right up to the glowing crystalline formations.

As you get closer, the crystals begin pulsing faster and brighter. The electromagnetic field intensifies, and your environmental suit's systems start failing.

> "Captain, get back!" Dr. Kim shouts, but it's too late.

The crystals react violently to your presence, releasing a massive energy discharge. You're caught in the blast, and your suit overloads completely.

**You have died from crystal energy overload.**

The *Nebula Explorer* watches helplessly as your life signs disappear. Your mission ends in tragedy, and the mystery of Colony Alpha-7 remains unsolved.
