# üöÄ Ending 2: The Great Escape

You decide to evacuate Dr. Vasquez immediately, despite the risks. You and your crew work quickly to get her aboard the shuttle, but the crystals react violently to your departure.

As you race back to the *Nebula Explorer*, the entire planet begins to glow with angry energy. The crystals are not happy about losing their "guests."

You barely make it back to the ship before the planet's surface erupts in a massive crystal explosion. The *Nebula Explorer* is damaged but functional.

Dr. Vasquez survives, though she remains partially crystalline. Back at Federation headquarters, scientists study her condition and the crystal samples you collected. They discover that the crystals are indeed sentient and potentially dangerous.

**You have successfully rescued a survivor and brought back crucial information about the alien crystals. The Federation decides to quarantine the planet and study the crystals from a safe distance.**
