# ðŸ’€ Ending 10: The Tragic End

You make a critical error in judgment. Perhaps you ignored the warning signs, or maybe you were too reckless in your approach to the mysterious crystals.

As you attempt to interact with the crystalline formations, something goes horribly wrong. The crystals react violently to your presence, and before you can react, you're caught in a massive energy discharge.

The last thing you see is a brilliant flash of blue light as the crystalline energy overwhelms your systems. Your crew tries to help, but it's too late.

**You have died. Your mission ends here.**

The *Nebula Explorer* returns to the Federation with a tragic report: Captain Alex Chen was lost during the investigation of Colony Alpha-7. The planet remains a mystery, and the fate of the colonists is still unknown.

ðŸ’€ **Mission Status: FAILURE - You Died**
