# ðŸš€ Scene 2D: Taking Control

You decide to take control of the ship yourself. "I can handle this," you say confidently to Lieutenant Patel.

But you're feeling overconfident. "I've been flying ships for years," you reply. "How hard can it be?"

You take the pilot's seat and begin your descent toward the planet. The controls feel different than you expected, and the gravitational pull is stronger than you're used to.

As you approach the colony dome, you notice the crystalline formations are much larger up close than they appeared from orbit. The electromagnetic interference is also affecting your instruments.

What do you do?
