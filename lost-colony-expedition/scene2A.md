# 🔍 Scene 2A: Drone Reconnaissance

You decide to play it safe and send a reconnaissance drone first. Mac launches the drone while Dr. Kim monitors the data feed.

The drone's cameras reveal a shocking sight: the colony buildings are still there, but they've been transformed. The structures are now covered in the same crystalline material, glowing with that strange blue energy.

As the drone approaches the main colony dome, it suddenly loses contact. The last image shows something moving inside the dome - something that definitely wasn't human.

> "Captain, I'm picking up a distress signal!" Lieutenant Patel calls out. "It's weak, but it's definitely human origin."

The signal is coming from deep underground, beneath the colony. Someone is still alive down there.

How do you proceed?
