# ðŸ’€ Ending 12: Clumsy Pilot Crash

You decide to try to land anyway, despite all the warnings. "I can handle this," you say stubbornly.

As you continue your descent, the electromagnetic interference becomes overwhelming. Your instruments are completely haywire, and you're flying blind. The ship starts to wobble uncontrollably.

> "Captain, pull up! Pull up!" Lieutenant Patel shouts from the co-pilot seat.

But you're too disoriented to respond properly. You accidentally hit the wrong thruster, and the ship spins out of control. Before you can correct it, you crash directly into the crystalline formations below.

**You have died in a clumsy piloting accident.**

The *Nebula Explorer* watches helplessly as your ship spirals out of control and crashes. Your mission ends in embarrassment and tragedy. The Federation will remember you as the captain who crashed his own ship.

ðŸ’€ **Mission Status: FAILURE - Clumsy Pilot Crash**
