# 💎 Ending 6: The Transformed Colonists

You ask to see the transformed colonists. The crystals lead you to a vast underground chamber where the colonists are being kept.

What you see is both beautiful and terrifying: the colonists have been transformed into crystalline beings, but they're still conscious. They can communicate with you through the crystal network, and they seem happy with their new existence.

Dr. Elena Vasquez appears before you, now fully crystalline but still recognizably human. She explains that the transformation was voluntary - the colonists chose to become one with the crystals to gain immortality and new abilities.

The crystals offer you the same choice: you can become one of them, gaining incredible powers and eternal life, or you can return to humanity as their ambassador.

What do you choose?

- 💎 [Accept the transformation](./ending7.md)
- 🚀 [Return as ambassador](./ending8.md)
- ⚠️ [Refuse and leave](./ending9.md)
