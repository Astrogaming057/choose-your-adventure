# ⚠️ Ending 9: The Rejection

You refuse the transformation and choose to leave. The crystals understand your decision but warn you that humanity may not be ready for what's coming.

As you return to the Federation, you report your findings: the crystals are sentient, potentially dangerous, and have already transformed the colonists. The Federation decides to quarantine the planet and study the crystals from a safe distance.

However, your rejection has consequences. The crystals begin to expand their influence, and other colonies start reporting strange crystalline formations. The Federation realizes that the crystals are not just on one planet - they're spreading throughout the galaxy.

**You have successfully completed your mission, but your rejection of the crystals has unintended consequences. The Federation must now deal with a growing crystal threat that could affect the entire galaxy.**

⚠️ **Mission Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS - Unintended Consequences**
