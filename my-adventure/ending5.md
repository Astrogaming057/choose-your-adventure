# üöÄ Ending 5: The Federation Report

You decide to leave and report to the Federation. The crystals understand your decision and allow you to depart peacefully.

Back at Federation headquarters, you present your findings: the crystals are sentient, potentially dangerous, and have already transformed the colonists. The Federation decides to quarantine the planet and study the crystals from a safe distance.

Dr. Kim's analysis of the crystal samples reveals incredible potential for technology, but also significant risks. The Federation begins a long-term study program to understand the crystals without direct contact.

You are commended for your caution and thorough reporting. The Federation establishes a research station in orbit around the planet to monitor the crystals and learn from them safely.

**You have successfully completed your mission and provided the Federation with crucial information about the alien crystals. While you didn't establish contact, you ensured the safety of your crew and provided valuable scientific data.**
