# 🧠 Scene 4A: Direct Communication

You decide to try establishing direct communication with the crystals. Dr. Kim hooks up a neural interface that allows you to connect with the crystal network.

The experience is overwhelming. You suddenly understand the crystals' perspective - they see the universe as a vast network of energy and information. They've been waiting for intelligent life to discover them, hoping to share their knowledge and evolve together.

The crystals show you visions of the colony's fate: the colonists didn't die - they were transformed. Some became fully crystalline, others became hybrids, and a few remained human but gained new abilities.

The crystals offer you a choice: you can help them establish peaceful contact with humanity, or you can leave and let them continue their isolation.

What's your decision?
