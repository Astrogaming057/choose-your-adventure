# ðŸ†˜ Scene 3G: Rescue Mission

You decide to attempt an immediate rescue mission. You, Dr. Kim, and Lieutenant Patel suit up and head down to the planet's surface.

As you approach the underground facility, you discover a massive crystal chamber. Dr. Elena Vasquez is there, but she's been partially transformed by the crystals. Her skin has a crystalline sheen, and she seems to be in constant communication with the crystal network.

> "Captain, you shouldn't have come," she says weakly. "The crystals are sentient. They're trying to understand us, to become us. But the process... it's not complete. We're trapped between human and crystal."

She explains that the colony discovered the crystals were alive, but when they tried to study them, the crystals began absorbing human consciousness. Some colonists became fully crystalline, others died, and a few like her are stuck in between.

What do you do?
