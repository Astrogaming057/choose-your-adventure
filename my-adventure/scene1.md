# 🌌 Scene 1: The Jump to Alpha-7

After three weeks of travel through hyperspace, you arrive at the coordinates of Colony Alpha-7. The *Nebula Explorer* drops out of warp speed, and your crew gathers on the bridge.

The planet below is... wrong. Instead of the lush, Earth-like world described in the colony reports, you see a desolate, rocky surface with strange crystalline formations glowing with an eerie blue light.

Dr. Kim's sensors detect massive energy readings from the planet's surface, but no signs of human life.

> "Captain, these readings are off the charts," Dr. Kim reports. "I've never seen anything like this."

Mac's engineering scans reveal something even more disturbing: the planet's atmosphere has changed completely since the colony was established.

What's your first move?
