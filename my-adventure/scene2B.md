# ðŸ‘¥ Scene 2B: Landing Party

You decide to take a bold approach and lead a landing party down to the planet's surface. You, Dr. Kim, and Lieutenant Patel suit up in environmental protection gear and board the shuttle.

As you descend through the planet's atmosphere, you notice the crystals seem to pulse with energy, almost as if they're alive. The shuttle's instruments go haywire near the colony dome.

> "Captain, I'm detecting massive electromagnetic interference," Mac reports over the comm. "The crystals are generating some kind of field."

You land near the main colony dome. The buildings are covered in the crystalline material, but you can see through the transparent sections. Inside, everything appears frozen in time - tables set for dinner, children's toys scattered about.

Suddenly, Dr. Kim's scanner picks up movement inside the dome. Something is definitely alive in there.

What do you do?
